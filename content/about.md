This is my personal website 

My name is Jo√£o Castello Branco. I have a Bachelors degree in Economics from the Institute of Economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (IE/UFRJ) and I'm a Masters Analysis and Policy (APE) candidate at Paris School of Economics (PSE). I expect to graduate during the (european) summer of 2021.

Master's Thesis: Uncertainty and Business Cycles in Latin America: Linear and Non Linear VAR analysis

I am interested in working and researching topic in applied economics such as macroeconomics (International Macro, Fiscal and Monetary policy) and microeconomics (Political Economy, education and labor market).

I'm also learning how to cook and one day I will be running a (half?) marathon.
