This is my personal website 

My name is Jo√£o Castello Branco. I have a Bachelors degree in Economics from the Institute of Economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (IE/UFRJ) and Currently pursuing master's degrees in Analysis and Policy in Economics (APE) at the Paris School of Economics (PSE). I expect to graduate during the (european) summer of 2021.

Master's Thesis: Uncertainty and Business Cycles in Latin America: Linear and Non Linear VAR analysis

I am interested in working and researching topic in applied economics such as macroeconomics (International Macro, Fiscal and Monetary policy) and microeconomics (Political Economy, education and labor market).

I'm also learning how to cook and one day I will be running a (half?) marathon.
